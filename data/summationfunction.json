What is the best way I could create a dynamic system that allows me to set a maximum token size to reduce costs, utilize the most conversation history, but also provide me an adequate response? lets say that the max_tokens allowed in a call is 1000, split between the input and output. \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your current `trim_conversation_history` function has a good start by truncating the history based on the max token capacity. To make the token allocation dynamic, you could consider the length of the incoming message and allocate a proportion of the remaining tokens to the response, ensuring that the combined token count doesn't exceed the `max_tokens` limit.\n\nHere's an approach that might help:\n\n1. Determine an allocation ratio for the incoming message versus the response. For instance, if you want to ensure that the response is at least as long as the incoming message, you could set a 1:1 ratio or adjust it according to your needs.\n\n2. Count the tokens in the incoming message.\n\n3. Calculate the maximum number of tokens that can be allocated for the response, ensuring the total does not exceed `max_tokens`.\n\n4.

Here are some approaches you might consider:\n\n1. **Prioritize Recent Messages**: As the conversation progresses, older messages may become less relevant. By prioritizing the truncation of older messages, you can preserve more of the recent context.\n\n2. **Semantic Truncation**: Instead of cutting off at an arbitrary token limit, try to truncate at natural conversation breakpoints such as sentence or topic boundaries. This can lead to more coherent excerpts of the conversation.\n\n3. **Summarization**: Implement a summarization step where older parts of the conversation are replaced with shorter summaries that encapsulate the main points, which allows for the preservation of context with less token usage.\n\n4. **Context Morpher**: Develop an algorithm that can morph the context by extracting key entities, intents, and sentiments from previous exchanges and weave them into a shorter reformulated context, that still captures the essence of the conversation.\n\n5. **Interactive Truncation**: Allow the model to decide what to drop by prompting it with an instruction, like \"Here is a long conversation history, summarize it while keeping key points and removing redundant information.\"\n\n6. **Relevance Feedback Adjustments**: Periodically check in with the user to ensure the conversation is on track. If the model's replies are losing coherence or relevance, you can adjust your truncation strategy accordingly.\n\n7. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine the above methods to create a context window that intelligently maintains the relevance and coherence of the conversation.\n\nTo apply these concepts, here's how you might adjust your truncation function:\n\n```python\ndef smart_truncate_conversation(conversation_history, incoming_message, max_total_tokens):\n    # Define an approach to summarize and truncate messages\n    def summarize_and_truncate(messages, max_len):\n        # Implement your chosen summarization technique here\n        # For the sake of this example, we're just taking the last few messages\n        token_count = 0\n        summary = []\n        for message in reversed(messages):\n            token_count += self.count_tokens_in_messages([message], model=self.model)\n            if token_count <= max_len:\n                summary.insert(0, message)\n            else:\n                break\n        return summary\n    \n    # Calculate the available tokens for the history and the response\n    incoming_tokens = self.count_tokens_in_messages([incoming_message], model=self.model)\n    max_history_tokens = max_total_tokens - incoming_tokens\n    \n    # Summarize and truncate older parts of the conversation if necessary\n    summarized_history = summarize_and_truncate(conversation_history, max_history_tokens)\n    \n    # The response can use the remaining tokens\n    response_token_limit = max_total_tokens - self.count_tokens_in_messages(summarized_history, model=self.model)\n    \n    return summarized_history, response_token_limit\n\n# Example usage\nincoming_msg = \"What's the latest in AI research?\"\nconversation_history = [...]  # Your existing conversation history\nmax_tokens = 2048  # Maximum GPT-3 model token limit, for example\ntruncated_history, response_token_limit = smart_truncate_conversation(conversation_history, incoming_msg, max_tokens)\n```\n\nBy implementing these or similar strategies, you not only make better use of tokens but also enhance the coherence and relevance of the conversation, leading to a better experience for users interacting with the ChatGPT API."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you help define a summarization method to use for my conversation history? lets use this smart_truncate_conversation() method, but help me construct the summarization method to use in my program to best enhance coherance, and make better use of tokens."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly!
