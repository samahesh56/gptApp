How can I ignore this file so that the default prompt stays the same on git commits? "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ignore the `configs.json` file so that changes to it won't be tracked in git commits, you can add it to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory. \n\nIf you don't have a `.gitignore` file yet, you can create one. Within the `.gitignore` file, simply add a line with the filename `configs.json`. This will tell Git to ignore any changes or additions to that file.\n\nIf you're using the command line, you can navigate to your project's directory and run these commands:\n```bash\necho \"configs.json\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\nIf you prefer to do this through a text editor, simply open up a text editor, create a file called `.gitignore` in your project's root directory, and insert the line `configs.json` in it.\n\nOnce you've added the filename to your `.gitignore` file, any changes you make to `configs.json` won't be tracked in future commits."}]}
