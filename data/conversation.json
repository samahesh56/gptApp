"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ignore the `configs.json` file so that changes to it won't be tracked in git commits, you can add it to the `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory. \n\nIf you don't have a `.gitignore` file yet, you can create one. Within the `.gitignore` file, simply add a line with the filename `configs.json`. This will tell Git to ignore any changes or additions to that file.\n\nIf you're using the command line, you can navigate to your project's directory and run these commands:\n```bash\necho \"configs.json\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\nIf you prefer to do this through a text editor, simply open up a text editor, create a file called `.gitignore` in your project's root directory, and insert the line `configs.json` in it.\n\nOnce you've added the filename to your `.gitignore` file, any changes you make to `configs.json` won't be tracked in future commits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "this didnt seem to work.

First, ensure that the `.gitignore` file has been committed and pushed to the repository.\n\n2. If changes to `configs.json` are already being tracked, you'll need to untrack the file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   git rm --cached configs.json\n   ```\n\n3. After running the command, commit the changes:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Untrack configs.json file\"\n   ```\n\n4. Finally, when you make changes to `configs.json` and have the `.gitignore` file set up, these changes should no longer be included in your commits.\n\nAfter these steps, any changes made to `configs.json` should be ignored in future commits. If you're still encountering issues, make sure to double-check the syntax and placement of the `.gitignore` file, and ensure that the file name is spelled correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how do i know which files are currently being tracked, and which to untrack"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can use the `git status` command to see which files are currently being tracked and differentiated from files that are untracked. When you run this command, Git will display a list of files that have been modified, as well as those that are staged for the next commit, along with any untracked files.\n\nTo specifically view the files that are currently tracked, you can look for the files listed under the \"Changes to be committed\" section. These are the tracked files that have been modified. Conversely, any file listed under the \"Untracked files\" section are not currently being tracked by Git.\n\nTo untrack a file that is currently being tracked, you can use the following command:\n```bash\ngit rm --cached <file_name>\n```\nReplace `<file_name>` with the name of the file you want to untrack.\n\nAfter running this command, the file will be untracked, and you can then commit the changes to remove it from tracking."}]}
